       <h2>About me</h2>
        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>I am a person born in 2005 (Generation Z). I love doing something related on computers. Now I study Information Technology, and I live in Hanoi.</p>
        <h3>Why did I create this website?</h3>
        <p>I just create this website due to my curiosity and my passion. However, I plan to pursue a career in software, not web system building, so this website looks not so beautiful, forgive me. I'm trying to bring to you more better contents (maybe including the source code of an OS?)</p>
        <h3>What does "Limorina" mean?</h3>
        <p>It means nothing. I ask <i>Bard AI</i> and it gives me some of crazy explanations. I think the most "possible" explanation is here: "Limorina" comes from "limor", which means "myrrh" in Hebrew (I don't know what "myrrh" means, lmao).</p>
        <h2>I am a user at Wikipedia</h2>
        <p>I know Wikipedia when I was in grade 4. At that time, I had no knowledge to edit. When I was in grade 7 (2018), I created an account, and then I create many accounts because I had no recovery emails to take account back (I forgot passwords lmao), but then I knew that creating a lot accounts made me unable to contribute to Wikipedia. From then, I only use the account named Just Limorina.</p>
